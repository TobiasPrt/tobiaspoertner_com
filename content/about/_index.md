During my bachelors degree in Multimedia Production at the University of Applied Sciences in Kiel I developed an interest in programming. Later this year I’ll start my masters programm in media and computer science at the Technische Hochschule Lübeck. I enjoy every step of production, from conceptual work over design to developement. Other than Web-Development, I am comfortable working on the backend as well as developing mobile applications with Flutter. I take pride in being a team player and am an organisational talent.
