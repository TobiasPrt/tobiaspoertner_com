During my bachelor's degree in Multimedia Production at the University of Applied Sciences in Kiel, I developed an interest in programming. This year I started my master's program in media and computer science at the University of Applied Sciences in Lübeck. I enjoy every step of production, from conceptual work over the design to development. Other than Web-Development, I am comfortable working on mobile applications with Flutter. My skills beyond development include product management and analyzing behavioral user data. I take pride in being a team player and am an organizational talent.
